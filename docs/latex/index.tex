This module for Linux kernel allows threads to subscribe to a group in order to exchange messages and synchronize between each other. In simple terms, the entire subsystem can be divided into the following sub-\/modules\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Messages System}}\+: handles the exchanges of messages between threads
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Delayed messages\+: allows threads to post messages that will become available once a delay is expired
\item Garbage Collector\+: routine that periodically free storage memory by deleting delivered messages
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Synchronization system}}\+: allows threads to be descheduled until another thread woke them up.
\item {\bfseries{Parameter config system}}\+: install a sysfs that allows authorized users to config group’s parameter
\end{DoxyItemize}

Messages in a group are delivered to readers in F\+I\+FO order. Threads can subscribe to a group’s messages and when they do they become an “active member” of that group.~\newline
 When a thread reads a message, the module adds its P\+ID to the message’s list of recipients. Later, the garbage collector will traverse the messages F\+I\+FO queue and compare the set of message’s recipients with the set of active members\+: if active members are a subset of a message’s recipients, the message is removed and memory is freed. ~\newline

Each group has a field that describes its owner\+: an owner is represented by an U\+ID that corresponds to the user that installed the group. By default any threads can edit the group’s parameters both through the “sysfs parameter config system” and by interacting with the group\textquotesingle{}s facilities (via ioctl). To prevent this, it is possible to set the “strict mode” flag of a group\+: when this flag is active, only the current owner of a group can modify its internal parameters.
